# ByTheDoor_P2
Project #2 for the group By The Door


# Project 2

## Group project
This is a group project.
You should work in groups of 2 to 4 (not alone and not more than 4). If this is a problem, please let me know ahead of time.

The following are required elements of the final script(s) that are turned in:

  * The script should read from a file **or** use a web service or read a web page.
  * The script should have at least *one each* of the following flow control elements:
    * for or while loop
    * if statement
  * You must define and use at least two functions
  * You must import at least one module (e.g., os, re, argparse, numpy, pandas, etc.)
  * You must write something to a file
  

You may choose **one** of the following for what your script does as long as it meas the above criteria.

1. Write a script to analyze the flight data from PS2. You can choose what you want to analyze, or ask for help if you can't think of anything.

2. Write a script to query an API and display some result of your interest. In the Web Services class, I pointed out [this list of public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis), there are others. If you have an idea, I can try to help find a data source and API.

3. Write a script that does anything of your choice. This is kind of wide open, but remember the criteria above. Each of thos criteria must be satisfied in your script for full points.
